# diabetes-prediction-project
---This is a project for predicting diabetes using machine learning algorithms namely Logistic Regression,Naive bayes classifier,SVM and Random forest.
   A web application is also made regrading the same using streamlit ---
---Diabetes is predicted based on the features like glucose level,insulin,age,skin thickness,pregnancies,etc and the result is given based on accuracy score,
   recall,precision and auc score ---

   
- Diabetes prediction mini project gui.py is the JUPYTER notebook file of the code
- diabetes.csv is the kaggle diabetes dataset
- .pkl are the pickle forms for the respective algorithms
- screenshot of interface is the sample of the web interface
- There are 4 forms for 4 algorithms in the application

# installation and execution
- Install all the required packages
- execute the command : python gui.py
- execute : streamlit run gui.py to get the application in the browser
